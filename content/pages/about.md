## What is Strato?
Strato is an open source and experimental emulator that runs on ARMv8 Android™ devices and emulates the functionality of a Nintendo Switch™ system.  
Strato was designed to provide an accurate, performant, and user-friendly emulation experience through an ARM Compatibility Layer and System Emulation.

## When was Strato started?
Strato was started after [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-emu), a previous Nintendo Switch™ emulator, was discontinued in May 2023. The Strato Project was created to continue the work of Skyline, fixing its issues and improving its performance and compatibility.

## Who develops Strato?
The Strato Project is currently developed by [Lynx](https://github.com/lynxnb) and [TheASV](https://github.com/TheASVigilante). They are both full-time students and work on the emulator in their free time.  
The Strato team also has a few contributors who help with the development of the emulator.

## Where does the name come from?
The name "Strato" means "layer" in Italian. It was chosen to represent the ARM Compatibility Layer that Strato uses to run Nintendo Switch™ games on Android™ devices.

## How can I contribute to Strato?
As an open source project, the Strato team greatly encourages contributions of any kind.
